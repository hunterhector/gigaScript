21913	"HDFRE"	"his"	"fellow-citizens"	13	14	1913	"Cicero , who had so often defended the lives and fortunes of <b>his</b> <b>fellow-citizens</b> , was rewarded with legacies to the amount of a hundred and seventy thousand pounds ; nor do the friends of the younger Pliny seem to have been less generous to that amiable orator .

22907	"HDFRE"	"his"	"fellow-citizens"	25	26	2907	"This heroic chief escaped the power of a foe who might either have honored or punished his obstinate valor ; but many thousands of <b>his</b> <b>fellow-citizens</b> were involved in a general massacre , and Sapor is accused of treating his prisoners with wanton and unrelenting cruelty .

20672	"HDFRE"	"their"	"fellow-citizens"	49	50	672	"Those honors still attracted the vain ambition of the Romans ; and the emperors themselves , though invested for life with the powers of the consul ship , frequently aspired to the title of that annual dignity , which they condescended to share with the most illustrious of <b>their</b> <b>fellow-citizens</b> .

21935	"HDFRE"	"their"	"fellow-citizens"	28	29	1935	"The army is the only order of men sufficiently united to concur in the same sentiments , and powerful enough to impose them on the rest of <b>their</b> <b>fellow-citizens</b> ; but the temper of soldiers , habituated at once to violence and to slavery , renders them very unfit guardians of a legal , or even a civil constitution .
